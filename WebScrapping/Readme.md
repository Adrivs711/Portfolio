Hello!
Audiencias.py is a notebook where I extract spanish audience TV info from https://www.formulatv.com/audiencias/ using Web Scrapping techniques.
This dataset contains the best 25 programs that more audience have had for each day.
This dataset is interactive, meaning that you can extract as many days as you want, I extracted a dataset with info from year 2010 till now and uploaded it on Kaggle
