Welcome! 

Indian consumption habits.ipynb is a notebook were I will supose an Indian bank contacted me to group their clients on the basis of their consumption and extract insights and conclussions from it.

This dataset is taken from Kaggle, this is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/analyzing-credit-card-spending-habits-in-india

This notebook will follow all steps for a complete Machine Learning project applied for clustering modelling:
  - Step 1 - Reading data, check nulls, check dtypes
  - Step 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Step 3 - Process and scale data
  - Step 4 - Looking for number of clusters
  - Step 5 - PCA (Principal component analysis)
  - Step 6 - KPrototypes
  - Step 7 - Plots and conclussions

Feel free to contact me for any doubt or way to improve this project.
