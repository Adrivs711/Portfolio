## üéØ Overview

The chatbot is built as a full-stack AI application that:

- Understands user intents via LLM-based keyword extraction and classification.  
- Recommends courses through semantic search powered by embeddings and vector databases.  
- Stores and manages user sessions, conversation history, and course enrollments using cloud services.  
- Offers a seamless conversational experience with real-time chat, authentication, and personalized course suggestions.
