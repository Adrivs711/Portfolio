Welcome! 

Indian consumption habits.ipynb is a notebook were I will imagine an Indian bank contacted me to group their clients on the basis of their consumption and extract insights and conclussions from it.

This dataset is taken from Kaggle, this is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/analyzing-credit-card-spending-habits-in-india

This notebook will follow all steps for a complete Machine Learning project applied for clustering modelling:
  - Step 1 - Reading data, check nulls, check dtypes
  - Step 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Step 3 - Scaling data
  - Step 4 - Plot dendograms
  - Step 5 - K-Means model
  - Step 6 - PCA (Principal component analysis)
  - Step 7 - Second K-Means model
  - Step 8 - Second PCA
  - Step 9 - Plots, interpretations and conclussions

Feel free to contact me for any doubt or way to improve this project.
