Titanic_competition.ipynb notebook solves a Kaggle competition were I use machine learning algorithms to predict who survives in the Titanic.

Link to the competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic

In this Jupyter notebook I will follow all steps for a complete Machine Learning project:
  - Step 1 - Reading data and understanding format
  - Step 2 - Merge training and test.
  - Step 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis EDA
  - Step 4 - Data cleaning
  - Step 5 - First model approach
  - Step 6 - Comparison between models (Random Forest, Linear Regression and Lightgbm)
  - Step 7 - Improvement of the model - Transformation of numeric columns
  - Step 8 - Improvement of the model - Feature selection
  - Step 9 - Improvement of the model - GridSearchCV

Feel free to contact me for any doubts, ideas or ways to improve.
