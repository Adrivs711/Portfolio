Electricity consumption UK.ipynb shows a project were, as Data Scientist, I predict and bring insights about the UK electricity consumption for the rest of 2024 (May 2024 - December 2024).
The dataset used can be found in kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/albertovidalrod/electricity-consumption-uk-20092022 , this dataset has National Demand of electricity in UK from 2009 to our days.
For the sake of the analysis I take just the columns of National Demand and SETTLEMET_DATA.
With this objetive in mind I will follow all steps required for a complete Time-series Data Science project:
 - Step 1: Read data and make proper changes
 - Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Step 3 - First approach - Smoothing
 - Step 4 - Second model - SARIMA
 - Step 5 - Predictions for the rest of 2024
 - Step 6 - Analysis of the predictions - Insights
Feel free to contact me for any doubts, ideas or ways to improve.
