Hello!

Audiencias.py is a notebook where I extract spanish audience TV info from https://www.formulatv.com/audiencias/ using Web Scrapping techniques.

This script extracts the best 25 TV programs that more audience have had for each day, from selected day until today.

This script is interactive, meaning that you can extract as many days as you want, I extracted a dataset with info from year 2010 till now and uploaded it on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrivs711/spanish-tv-audiences-january-2010-june-2024/

The columns on this dataset are:

- fecha: Date
- cadena: Television channel
- programa: Program title
- nombre: Program name or subtitle
- hora: Hour the program was emitted
- duracion: Duration in minutes of the program
- espectadores: People watching the program
- share: Percentage of share

The way of using it is just executing the script and insert the desired day in the console as showed in the image:

This previous example will extract info from 2010 until today.

It will save the data as csv on the current folder location you are working.

Feel free to message me with any kind of idea or ways to improve.
