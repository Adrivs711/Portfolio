Titanic.ipynb solves a Kaggle competition that tries to predict who survives in the Titanic.

In this Jupyter notebook I will follow all steps for a complete Machine Learning project:
  - Step 1 - Reading data and understanding format
  - Step 2 - Create new variable called "train" and merge training and test, just to make sure changes done at the training set will also be done at test dataset.
  - Step 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis EDA
  - Step 4 - Data cleaning
  - Step 5 - First model approach
  - Step 6 - Comparison between models (Random Forest, Linear Regression and Lightgbm)
  - Step 7 - Improvement of the model - Transformation of numeric columns
  - Step 8 - Improvement of the model - Feature selection
  - Step 9 - Improvement of the model - GridSearchCV

Feel free to contact me for any doubts, ideas or ways to improve.
